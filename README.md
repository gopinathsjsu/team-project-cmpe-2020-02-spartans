### XP Core Values
**Feedback:**
Our team held regular meetings to review all the code we created. Throughout the project, each of us gave and received constructive feedback on the features implemented and how we could improve them further. Feedback was incorporated to improve our code quality and project outcomes.

**Respect:**
Our team was able to follow this core value as we all contributed to creating a collaborative and welcoming environment. All of our team members have different backgrounds and experiences so we were able to support each other by sharing ideas and knowledge. Everything produced in the project was through collaboration as we collectively decided on features and priorities.
