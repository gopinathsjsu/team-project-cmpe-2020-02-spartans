# XP Core Values
**Feedback:**
Our team held regular meetings to review all the code we created. Throughout the project, each of us gave and received constructive feedback on the features implemented and how we could improve them further. Feedback was incorporated to improve our code quality and project outcomes. Feedback from testing played a crucial role when debugging errors in the RestaurantSearchView. After implementing the filters, test results were analyzed using tools like Postman and log statements. We iteratively adjusted the filters based on feedback from tests, refining the logic for the core search features. This constant feedback loop helped identify and resolve edge cases efficiently. Additionally we made use of pair programming to resolve issues together and speed up developement.

**Respect:**
Our team was able to follow this core value as we all contributed to creating a collaborative and welcoming environment. All of our team members have different backgrounds and experiences so we were able to support each other by sharing ideas and knowledge. For example Faisal was specialized in the frontend, Eric and Haroon in the backend and Siddharth in cloud and deployment. We drew on each others knowledge to complete the project while respecting each others boundaries. Everything produced in the project was through collaboration as we collectively decided on features and priorities.
